# `Saturn` â€” parallelism-safe data structures for Multicore OCaml

---

This repository is a collection of parallelism-safe data structures for OCaml 5.
They are contained in two packages:

- `Saturn` that includes every data structures and should be used by default if
  you just want parallelism-safe data structures..
- `Saturn_lockfree` that includes only lock-free data structures.

The available data structures are :

Ideal for throughput-focused scheduling using per-core work distribution. Note, `pop` and `steal` follow different ordering (respectively LIFO and FIFO) and have different linearization contraints. | [Dynamic circular work-stealing deque](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1073970.1073974) and [Correct and efficient work-stealing for weak memory models](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2442516.2442524)) |

Thread-safe as long as at most one thread acts as producer and at most one as consumer at any single point in time.                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Optimised for high number of threads. Not strictly FIFO. Note, it exposes two interfaces: a lockfree and a non-lockfree (albeit more practical) one.

| [MPSC Queue](src_lockfree/mpsc_queue.mli)                    | `Single_consumer_queue` (same)                | A multi-producer, single-consumer, thread-safe queue without support for cancellation. This makes a gooddata structure for a scheduler's run queue. It is used in [Eio](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio).                                                               | It is a single consumer version of the queue described in [Implementing lock-free queues](https://people.cs.pitt.edu/~jacklange/teaching/cs2510-f12/papers/implementing_lock_free.pdf).                      |

## Usage

`Saturn` can be installed from `opam`: `opam install saturn`. Sample usage of
`Work_stealing_deque` is illustrated below.

```ocaml
module Ws_deque = Work_stealing_deque.M

let q = Ws_deque.create ()

let () = Ws_deque.push q 100

let () = assert (Ws_deque.pop q = 100)
```

## Tests

Several kind of tests are provided for each data structure:

- unitary tests and `qcheck` tests: check semantics and expected behaviors with
  one and more domains;
- `STM` tests: check _linearizability_ for two domains (see
  [multicoretests library](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/multicoretests));
- `dscheck`: checks _non-blocking_ property for as many domains as wanted (for
  two domains most of the time). See
  [dscheck](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/dscheck).

See [test/README.md](test/README.md) for more details.

## Benchmarks

There is a number of benchmarks in `bench` directory. You can run them with
`make bench`. See [bench/README.md](bench/README.md) for more details.
